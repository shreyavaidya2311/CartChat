## Overview
 - Our solution comprises three layers â€“ *Online Shopping Platforms*, *Categories*, and *Products*.
 - On successful registration, the user will be able to view the various online shopping platforms and will be prompted to select three or more categories associated with those platforms. Subsequently, the list of top servers in those categories will be displayed to them. 
- The user can then select the servers he/she wishes to join and will be redirected to the core of the application, the community-based chat. 
- These servers will serve the purpose of chatting with fellow shoppers interested in the same products. 
- Our application will intercept these chats and recommend the most relevant products in that server as messages by our bot.
